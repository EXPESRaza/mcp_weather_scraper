   ```
4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   uvicorn server:app --reload

2. The server will be available at http://localhost:8000.

3. You can access the API documentation at:
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Making a Request

#### Using curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/weather -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"location": "Seattle"}'
```

#### Using Client.py script:

You can use the provided client.py script to make a request to the /weather endpoint.

1. Ensure the server is running.
2. Run the client.py script:
   python [client.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)

   The script sends a POST request with the following payload:

   ```json
   {
     "location": "Seattle"
   }
   ```

   The server will respond with weather data in JSON format, such as:

   ```json
   {
     "location": "Seattle",
     "temperature": "15Â°C",
     "humidity": "80%",
     "air_quality": "Good",
     "condition": "Cloudy"
   }
   ```
